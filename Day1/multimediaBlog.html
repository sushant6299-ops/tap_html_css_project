      The teaser for Toxic: A Fairy Tale for Grown-ups (released January 8,
      2026) introduces Yash in a stylized, action-packed role as Raya, setting
      the stage for a dark, intense cinematic experience. Directed by Geetu
      Mohandas, the 59-second promo opens with a gloomy, atmospheric funeral
      scene in a cemetery before shifting to a chaotic, high-octane atmosphere
      where a stylish, tattooed, and cigar-smoking Yash makes an explosive
      entrance, announcing "Daddy's home". The teaser, which generated over 35
      million views in its first 24 hours, features a controversial, intimate
      car scene that triggered debate over its bold content, with the Aam Aadmi
      Party's women's wing filing a complaint alleging obscenity and disrespect
      to cultural values. The film, which also stars Kiara Advani, Nayanthara,
      and Huma Qureshi, is described as a "fairy tale for grown-ups" and is
      scheduled for a worldwide release on March 19, 2026.
